ðŸŒ± Excited to share my latest project: a Smart Irrigation System that boosts agricultural efficiency using IoT! ðŸŒ¾

Our system monitors real-time soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, automatically controlling a pump to irrigate as needed. Data from sensors is sent to the ThingSpeak cloud for monitoring and analysis, allowing for precise and efficient water usage. Plus, you can access and control everything remotely via the Blynk app.

Equipment: Soil Moisture Sensor, DHT22 Sensor, Pump, Relay Module, Breadboard and Wires, Battery, ESP8266, LCD Screen with I2C Module.

Harnessing technology for smarter, greener agriculture! ðŸ’§ðŸ“¡
